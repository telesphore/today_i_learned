# The classic cellular automaton

- This version is in Zig, which has advantages and disadvantages.
  - Advantage: There are _many_ quality of life improvements over C.
  - Disadvantage: The language is still changing which will sometimes break things.
  - Disadvantage: Working with @Vectors can be awkward.
  - Learning resources are there but not plentiful.
- The Game of Life grid is being treated as a torus.

I's using raylib for the graphics.
