# A very simple arena allocator

Things to try:

- Use the OS page table for an allocator
- Create a scratch allocator
- Create a stack allocator
  - How to efficiently store the previous indexes in the arena?
- There are other arena algorithms that may be useful for things like multi-threading etc.
